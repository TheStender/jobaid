# Post Pay Job Aid

This job aid was created in order to assist me with my work. It calculates dates, provides a checklist of steps, and allows for instant verbiage copying.

Languages used include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap

This is the archived version, as I am currently trying to create an improved version using .NET and MVC
