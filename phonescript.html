<h2>Phone Script</h2>
<p>Hello, this is <insert your name> calling from UnitedHealthcare. I am conducting an audit of previously paid claims. I am getting ready to send a request for medical records for multiple (one of your) patients. Before doing that, I wanted to confirm the address to send the request to.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Do you accept requests via fax or email for audits? If so, what is the best fax number/email address?</li>
<li>Can you also confirm the appropriate street address to include on the request? </li>
<li>Can you also provide the best phone number to follow up with if these records are not received?  Is there someone specific that I should be speaking with?</li>
<li>What is the timeframe for processing the request?</li>
<li>Do you have any questions for me? Is there anything special that I should include with my request?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time today.</p>
