Overall:
- add manual letter page and steps - through ups and through fax
- auto letters through mail page/step?
- add follow up page
- make word document with form fields(?) to enter info
- Clean up JavaScript code since you reuse a lot of code

- keep track of cases you're working and the steps you've completed, can tie in the info like picts case, destination id, etc - can save info when you go into phone script/manual letter steps, etc

Main Page:
- Area for detection ID and path (any way to save this? along with PICTS ID? write to text file? or just to variable to have saved somewhere? do i even need a variable? would i use them anywhere besides to copy individually? path would be useful and could have variables for different areas (ie: intake\medical records or \02 Clinical) where you can just click a button to copy the path needed)
- Use bootstrap to make everything awesome



Phone Script:
- Text Area for notes?


Receive Records:
- Add verbiage to copy (need case tracker SS for verbiage)
- add checkbox to step 5 if there's an invoice
- on step 8 (verbiage) add button for note, if invoice box is checked do the different note
- make text box for base path (at step 1?)
- for step 1 of invoice use that base path textbox to generate path for invoices with button
- for step 13 use the base path textbox to generate path for clinical with button
- hide invoice steps unless invoice button is checked, then show them



Verbiage:
- Enter all verbiage



Powershell if possible
- Write PICTS ID, Detection ID, info to/from excel file
